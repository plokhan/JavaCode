- $ Variable $

- Class lavel varbale  or static variable:-

 - before variable "static" is their then it is class level variable.

   ex:- class Student {
          int id;              --> three are intanse variable
          String name;   --> three are intanse variable
           String course;  --> three are intanse variable
           static String resultdate;  --> class level variable
          }  

 - for instance varibel can able to create two or more copy but for class level varibale or static variable  unable to create the copy 
 - instance varibale only create when object are created 
 - without object we can able to use the static variable so that we can save the memory.
 - instance variable have the different value for different object as well for different varibale  and must have the value.
 - But static varibale have same value for different object and able to create only one copy
 - static variable is not depend on object 
 - intanse variable is depend on object
 - we can use the static varible through the copy object.
    Client m1 = new Client();
	
	System.out.println(m1.maxmarks);
	
 - static variable memoryis create on hip after java 1.8    before 1.8 memory is created in method area
 - Static variable has same memory for different method  and changes has been happen in the same memory
 - Declare the static vatibale by its class name (best pratice)
