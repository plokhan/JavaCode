Q.What is Maven
R.It is a repositroy, project management tool, it hold dependency for all the jars


Generating OR in Java by using java libarary

***************************

In Group id while creating Maven project com.  is a category name //domain 

And Article id is a project name.


******************* 2nd May

What is Maven?
Ans:- It is repository. It is project management tool so can hold the dependencies for required project.

lombok :- it is clear the bolier plate code

Q.What is bolier plate code?
R.The same code repeatedly created.

Generate the QR
Download the library of geneerate the qr in pom.xml file

For mysql driver version always take  less than the mysql version

All dependencies jar is saved in .m2 

 ex:- C:\Users\krishna\.m2\repository\org\hibernate\hibernate-core\5.6.0.Final\hibernate-core-5.6.0.Final.jar
 
 ******************************5th May
 Q.What is Hibernate
 R. It is ORM framework
 It act as a patch between databases and java classes
 
 Q.What is ORM
 R.
 
 Folder Structure
 hibernate.cfg.xml
 
 @Entity:- corresponding with class the tabel has in databases if not in databases should have to create
 
 @Id  :- It represent the PRIMARY KEY in databases
 
 Running simple example
 
 Bussiness Logic [Business Class ] also called as service layer
 Model Class [Entity class]


 _________________________________________________  --> Product Studennt Merchants --> Hibernated is more of Model Classes
 
 DAO [Data Access Objects] :- connction with databases
 ____________________________________________________
 
 UI Classes
 ____________________________________________________
 DTO []
 
 
 To Create tabel of so we use the Entity annotation. For this have to create file with hibernate.cfg.file
 need DOCTYPE file search on goolge hibernate cfg git
 And Copy the code in hibernate file.
 
 
 -Directly use the below sessionFactory for creating session and configuration
     SessionFactory sessionFactory  = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
		Here we create configuration object and with the help of config create the session
	 
- Session session = sessionFactor.openSsession();

	 Boiler code :- To much code
	 
	 Do mapping in hibernate.cgf.xml  file and mention class name with fully qualified name (class name with package name)
	   ex:- <mapping class=" com.ka.getconnection.entity.Student" />
	 
 @Entity :- use for create data tabel in databases
 @Id :- use for mention PRIMARY KEY in databases
 
 commit();  :- if operation is done then comit  it on databases
 rollback(); :- if operation is not done then is rollback to pervious state
 
 *************************6th May
 
 HandsOn on hibernate

Student s1 = new Student(102, "abhay", "ME");

		Configuration cfg = new Configuration().configure();
		//cfg.addAnnotatedClass(Student.class);
		
		
		//Properties properties = cfg.getProperties();
		// properties.forEach((x , y) -> System.out.println(x+"  " + y));   --> it should be neglible
		
		
		SessionFactory sessionFacctory = cfg.buildSessionFactory();
		Session session = sessionFacctory.openSession();
		
		Transaction tx= null;
		
		try {
			tx =session.beginTransaction();
			session.save(s1);
			tx.commit();
			
			System.out.println("Transcation Successful.....");
			
		} catch (Exception e) {
			tx.rollback();
			e.printStackTrace();
			
			System.out.println("Transcation Unsuccessful ......");
			=


Can Do like this 

SessionFactory sessionFacctory = new Configuration().configure().buildSessionFactory();
		
		Session session = sessionFacctory.openSession();
		
		Transaction tx= null;

Hibernate Annotations  
Model 
DAO(Accessing data via DAO)
_____________________________________
LLD:- Low Level Design
HLD :- High Level Design 

DAO  :- Data Access Object


**********************************8 th May

What is POJO
Plain old java object 
Variable private getter setter, close state, no extend

Q. What is the role of toString
R. It is represent the state of the object 

		State means value of the variable
		
		
Connection Pulling:- 
	
		It is reserve the connection from the give connection is called connection pulling.
		With the session creatinig the connection and work with dtabases.

*************************************** 9th May

Write all the annotation ied in hibernate?
@Entity @Id

Also Write methods of the session class/
save 
save or Update
delete
get

**********************************12th May

What is dialect?
A dialect is a configuration setting 
that helps the ORM framework understand the specifics of a particular database system

What is session Factory?
Create a session 

Alternative ORMs instead of ORM?
MyBaties, apache openJPA

What is the advantage of hibernate?
1. Map java object to the entity tables --> primary advantage
2. frame work manage the relationship between the object and relation
3.reduce bolierplate code
4.improve the performance of application
************************************16th May
OneToOne
Use the annotiation @OneToOne when Mapping is onetoone
@Id
	int eid;
	String firstname;
	LocalDate jdate;
	
	@OneToOne
	AadharCard aadharcard;
	@OneToOne
	PassPort passport;


*************************************** 22nd May

Mapping 

When condition is OneToMany use the @OneToMany annotation 
int did;
	String dname;
	@OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
	@JoinColumn(name = "Deptid")
	List<Employee> emp;
	

****************************************23rd May
Mapping

To insert the data into existing table in databses --> use the --> @Table (name= "tableName");
To insert the varibale into particular column mention --> annotation --> @Column(name = "nameOfColumn") above the varibale
